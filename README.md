## About This Project

The project is a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. If you don’t know what that is check the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors) or [this ridiculous step-by-step](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Rock,-Paper,-Scissors). In the start screen there is an optional field of Name and option to select number of win required to win match (default is 3). The match will be between person and computer. Computer select Rock, Paper or Scissors randomly.
